ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a set of metrics used to evaluate automatic summarization and machine-generated texts by comparing them to human-written references. 
It mainly measures the overlap of n-grams (ROUGE-N), the longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L), and skip-bigrams between the generated and reference texts. 
Higher ROUGE scores indicate better quality. 
ROUGE is especially common in tasks like summarization, translation, and text generation.
